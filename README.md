## Multiview images to point clouds using Structure from Motion (SFM) Pipeline with OpenCV

This project is an implementation of a Structure from Motion (SFM) pipeline using Python and OpenCV to obtain point cloud from multiple images. SFM is a computer vision technique that reconstructs a 3D scene from a set of 2D images. The pipeline includes key stages such as feature detection, matching, camera calibration, essential matrix estimation, triangulation, bundle adjustment, and point cloud visualization.
